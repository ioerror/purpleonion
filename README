For usage run (using Mono as the example):
# mono Por.OnionGenerator.exe --help

COMPILATION
-----------
Por.OnionGenerator requires at least Mono 2.0 to compile and run. The
compiled binary will run on the .NET 2.0 framework with the appropriate
libraries available, but POSIX is not supported on Windows machines.

If the application will be run on a POSIX machine, support for receiving
certain terminating signals and exiting cleanly is automatically enabled
where Mono.Posix is available.

EXECUTION
---------
When POSIX signal handling is enabled, background threads will be allowed 
to complete their queued up work before terminating. Currently, SIGHUP,
SIGTERM, and SIGINT are processed as requests to exit. Since all
background threads are allowed to exit cleanly, a high numbers of workers
(greater than 2*num_procs) may cause the program to continue running for a
few seconds while the remaining worker threads finish processing.

Receiving a SIGKILL signal will immediately cause execution to cease;
this signal cannot be caught or handled.
