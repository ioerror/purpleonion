COMPILATION
-----------
PurpleOnion requires at least Mono 2.2 to compile and run, but with the
Mono.Options Options.cs code snippet placed in the 'src/' directory, will
compile with Mono 2.0. The compiled binary may run on the .NET 2.0
framework with the appropriate libraries available, but this has not been
tested.

If the application will be run on a POSIX machine, support for receiving
certain terminating signals and exiting cleanly can be enabled by adding
`POSIX=YesPlease' to the make command:

make POSIX=YesPlease

EXECUTION
---------
When POSIX signal handling is enabled, background threads will be allowed 
to complete their queued up work before terminating. Currently, SIGHUP,
SIGTERM, and SIGINT are processed as requests to exit. Since all
background threads are allowed to exit cleanly, a high numbers of workers
(greater than 2*num_procs) may cause the program to continue running for a
few seconds while the remaining worker threads finish processing.
